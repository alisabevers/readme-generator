# README Generator

## Description
This assignment came with starter code. It included the package.json file, which includes the inquirer library. I used this library to prompt the user with questions, which recorded user responses to eventually add to the readme template. A sample readme file (generated by running ```node index.js```) can be found in the Develop folder.

Click on this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8seWrBIpIrmx3kLpH_2R85RVAaYyDX2/view) to see a live demo of a README file being generated.

## Usage 
Someone can use this to quickly fill out a README file for their repo.

## Instructions
Simply answer the prompts in your terminal, and once you answer all the questions, a readme file should be generated.

## Credits
My prior activities/class content, googling, and Youtube helped me complete this assignment.
